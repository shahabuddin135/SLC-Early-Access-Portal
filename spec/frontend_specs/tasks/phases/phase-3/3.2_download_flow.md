@block TASK fe_3.2_download_flow
priority: critical
intent: "Build the download section component with download trigger and state update"
scope: phase-3
depends_on: [fe_3.1_dashboard_page]
estimate: 25
status: todo

content:
  - Add to lib/api.ts:
      - async function triggerDownload(token: string): Promise<{download_url: string} | null>
          - GET BACKEND_URL/api/v1/download with Authorization header
          - Return {download_url} on success

  - Create app/actions/download.ts (Server Action):
      - "use server"
      - async function downloadAction():
          - Get token from cookie
          - Call triggerDownload(token)
          - Return {download_url} or error

  - Create components/DownloadSection.tsx:
      - Props: hasDownloaded: bool
      - If hasDownloaded == false:
          - Show: "Download SLC Language & Framework" button (btn-primary)
          - On click: call downloadAction()
          - On success: open download_url in new tab, set local state hasDownloaded=true
          - Show loading state during action
      - If hasDownloaded == true:
          - Show: "✓ Downloaded" badge in orange
          - Show: "Download again" secondary link

  - Design requirements:
      - Download button: large, orange, full-width
      - Downloaded state: orange checkmark badge
      - Smooth transition between states

acceptance_criteria:
  - Download button calls GET /download and opens download_url
  - After download: button changes to "Downloaded" state
  - ReviewForm becomes visible after download (parent re-renders)
  - Loading state shown during API call
